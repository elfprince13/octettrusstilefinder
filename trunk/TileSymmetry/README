TileDriver

	To the run the program, open a terminal
session and change directory to the folder containing
TileDriver.class. Enter the following command:

	java TileDriver n

where n is the number of arms to run the program with
(0 - 12). Additional functionality can be accessed by
running the program with either the following commands:

	java TileDriver -os n
	java TileDriver -lm n


	Running with the -os option enables orbit/stabilizers
tracking, and will display all possible orientations for each
tile, as well as a list of any tiles that could not be generated
rotationally.

	Running with the -lm option enables a textual interface
into which you can enter an arbitrary n-armed tile, and have it
return the lex-minimal form.
